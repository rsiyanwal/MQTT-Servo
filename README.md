# MQTT-Servo
We can rotate the servo motor with a message received via MQTT. For instance, if we receive "L" in the message, we can rotate the motor to the left. Similarly, if we receive "R", we can rotate the motor to the right. This mechanism can be utilized in scenarios where we want to take pictures in a specific direction.
